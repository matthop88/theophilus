# THEO-005
## Test Suite Expansion

Type: STORY

### Description:
Currently, the Test Suite runs tests beautifully, but needs to have a better summary.

1. After each group of tests, should summarize how many tests passed.

Tests succeeded: 9 out of 9

2. If a test in a group fails, should say:

Tests succeeded: 8 out of 9

The following tests have failed:
Passage Expansion for Chapter and Verse, Happy Path

3. At end of tests, a full summary should be shown.

****************************************
***   Total Tests Succeeded: 52/52   ***
****************************************

4. If any tests have failed, a list of failed tests follows, including which group they belong to.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [X] Per group summary on succeeded tests
- [ ] List of failed tests per group
- [ ] Summary on all tests
- [ ] Failed tests summarized at end, aggregated by group
